  <p>
    My name is Jean Michel Rouly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://rallyhealth.com" target="_blank">Rally Health</a> where I use
    <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org" target="_blank">Scala</a> to build a web platform that simplifies healthcare
    for consumers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently I earned a masters degree in Computer Science from
    <a href="https://www.omscs.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before that I graduated from <a href="https://gmu.edu" target="_blank">George Mason University</a> with highest
    honors in Computer Science. During that time I conducted <a href="{{ url_for('views.research') }}">research</a> in
    machine learning and data mining. I formerly served as president of the George Mason
    <a href="https://srct.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Student Run Computing and Technology</a> organization.

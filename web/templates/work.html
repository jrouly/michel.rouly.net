  <h2>Rally Health</h2>

  <p>
    I am currently a Principal Software Engineer with <a href="https://rallyhealth.com">Rally Health</a>.
    We build products that help users navigate the American healthcare system: finding high quality care,
    filling prescriptions, and understanding prices. I primarily write in
    <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> using the
    <a href="https://github.com/playframework/playframework">Play web framework</a>.

  <h2>Harmonia</h2>

  <p>
    I was previously contracted with <a href="https://www.harmonia.com">Harmonia Holdings Group</a> as an independent
    Java programming consultant for the development of a learning classifier engine. My work included high level
    architecture design, user interface development, and software development to customer specification.

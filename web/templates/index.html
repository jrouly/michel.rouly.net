	My name is Jean Michel Rouly.
</p>

<p>
  I am a Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://rallyhealth.com">Rally Health</a> where I use
  <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> to build a web platform that simplifies healthcare for consumers.
</p>

<p>
  Recently I earned a masters degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.omscs.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Before that I graduated from <a href="https://gmu.edu">George Mason University</a> with highest honors in Computer
  Science. During that time I conducted <a href="{{ url_for('views.research') }}">research</a> in machine learning and
  data mining. I formerly served as president of the George Mason <a href="https://srct.gmu.edu">Student Run Computing
  and Technology</a> organization.
